== Version 4.1.0 Date TBD

== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:665]] Fixed to load socket routines from its DLL only when needed.
* [[ticket:744]] Detect duplicate ##case## values in a ##[[:switch statement]]## and throw
  an error at compile or parse time
* OS X bug fixes:
** Callbacks function again, including on 64bit platforms
** Memory maps function
* Fix std/net/http.e that caused malformed HTTP GET requests
* Updated demo/news.ex with up-to-date URLs for some news web sites.
* Fix std/net/http.e so it can handle cases where the Content-Length header is not present

== Enhancements

* Euphoria can be built natively as a 64-bit programming language.
* Added 8-byte memory access: [[:poke8], [[:peek8s]], [[:peek8u]]
* eucoverage also outputs a file "big_routines.html" that shows covered routines
  from all files sorted by descending routine size
* Added [[:poke_pointer]] and [[:peek_pointer]]
* New [[:sizeof]] built-in for determining size of certain data types.
* [[ticket:631]] Scientific parsing code moved from the euphoria source directory and into the
  standard library.  Routines in ##std/get.e## now return the proper precision data
  based on the native platform (32 or 64 bits).
* Users can write their own debuggers and use them instead of the built in trace debugger.
* gcc builds now include -fPIC (position independent code) runtime libraries for translating
  euphoria code into shared objects.
* -lib-pic switch for translator to specify the PIC runtime library to be used
* [[ticket:166]] get_integer{16,32} will return -1 on EOF.
* Added [[:deprecate]] keyword
* Architecture ifdefs (X86, X86_64, ARM, BITS32, BITS64, LONG32, LONG64)
* -arch option for translator for cross translating
* [[ticket:657]] name_of call added for display of alternative literals
* [[ticket:657]] warnings are displayed when two variables or literals of distinct enumerated types are compared or one is assigned to the other.
* -cc-prefix option for translator
* Can [[assign to multiple variables -> :Multiple Assignment]] with one statement using sequence semantics.
* Use ##?## to stand in for default parameters.
* eudis now tabulates counts of forward references
* Added [[:poke_long]], [[:peek_longu]] and [[:peek_longs]]
* [[ticket:735]] The number of lines to be used in ctrace.out by ##trace(3)## can be configured
  using ##-trace-lines n## command line switch. See [[Command line switches -> :command line switches]]
  for more information.
* [[ticket:782]] When downloading http content, std/net/http.e will yield to other tasks
* [[t_integer32]] type for checking to see if an object is an integer based on 32-bit Euphoria's definition
* Improved identification of ##routine_id()## targets by the translator
* Smaller translated DLLs are produced by improved identification of routines that need to be exported
* Eutest now has an eubin option for specifying all binaries in a single option.  
* Eutest has a retest option for retesting all tests that had previously failed.
* Front end optimizations to reduce parsing time
